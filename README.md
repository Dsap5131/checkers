# CHECKERS

## ABOUT

Hi. This project is to improve my skills. The goal is to create a simple game of checkers with extremely clean and professional code, to use the latest up-to-date practices and tools (including CI/CD), and to learn.

The specific goals of this project are to create checkers using Python and Flask. Use strong soft dev principles and use proper CI/CD tools. Then publish my first public project.

## TODO

1. Start :)
